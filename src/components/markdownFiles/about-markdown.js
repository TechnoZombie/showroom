# About

After many years in a totally different career path, I've embarked in a full-stack bootcamp back in September 2023.

By March 2024 I was stepping in to my first professional experience as a Java backend developer, focusing mainly in microservices built with Spring/SpringBoot.

During all this time, I kept doing personal projects that would allow me to keep learning at my own pace and keep developing my newly aqcuired skills.

This website is a portfolio of the most significant projects I've developed so far during my personal path for improvement.
Ranging from webapps developed with React+Vite to plain JavaScript to Java apps and libraries, a sample of this path can be seen here.

All projects have a link to their GitHub Repository where they can be seen in more detail.

Thank you for your visit!
