**DeadParrot** is a Java-based audio repeater designed for use in amateur radio setups. It listens for audio input, records the audio for a defined period or until silence is detected, and then plays back the same recording — just like a parrot!

This project mimics the behavior of a repeater station by automatically handling sound detection, recording, and playback, with minimal setup.

## 🔧 Configuration

DeadParrot is configured via the **\`\`Settings.java\`\`** class with the following main options:

### Operating Mode
- **\`\`USE_GUI\`\`** – Enable GUI mode (default: \`\`true\`\`). Set to \`\`false\`\` to run in console-only mode.

### Audio Configuration
- **\`\`AUDIO_FORMAT\`\`** – Standard audio format: PCM signed, 44.1kHz, 16-bit, stereo (read-only).
- **\`\`SOUND_DETECTION_SENSITIVITY\`\`** – Threshold for detecting sound (default: 5000). Higher values require louder audio.
- **\`\`SILENCE_THRESHOLD\`\`** – Amplitude threshold below which audio is considered silence (default: 500).
- **\`\`SILENCE_DURATION_MS\`\`** – Duration of continuous silence before stopping recording (default: 1500ms).
- **\`\`MAX_RECORDING_TIME_MS\`\`** – Maximum recording duration (default: 60000ms / 60 seconds).

### Operating Modes
- **\`\`SPY_MODE\`\`** – Enable spy mode: record only, no playback (default: \`\`false\`\`).
- **\`\`MARKER_MODE\`\`** – Enable marker mode: plays periodic marker sounds instead of repeating (default: \`\`false\`\`).
- **\`\`MARKER_TIME\`\`** – Interval between marker sounds in milliseconds (default: 50000ms / 5 minutes).
- **\`\`PLAY_MARKER\`\`** – Option to play markers during standard mode operation (default: \`\`false\`\`).

### Recording & Storage
- **\`\`KEEP_RECORDINGS\`\`** – Keep all recordings permanently (default: \`\`true\`\`). If \`\`false\`\`, recordings are deleted after playback.
- **\`\`SAVE_RECORDINGS_TO_DESKTOP\`\`** – Save files to Desktop/Recordings instead of local Recordings folder (default: \`\`true\`\`).

### User Interface & Features
- **\`\`OPEN_OS_RECORDING_SETTINGS\`\`** – Opens the OS sound recording settings on startup (default: \`\`true\`\`).
- **\`\`DARK_MODE\`\`** – Enable dark theme for the GUI (default: \`\`true\`\`).
- **\`\`EASTER_EGG\`\`** – Enable Monty Python parrot quotes on shutdown (default: \`\`false\`\`).
- **\`\`PRINT_SETTINGS\`\`** – Print all settings to console on startup (default: \`\`false\`\`).

These settings can be modified directly in \`\`Settings.java\`\` or through the GUI interface when running in GUI mode.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Standard Mode (Default Repeater Behavior)

1. \`\`Listener\`\` continuously monitors the audio input for audio that exceeds a defined threshold.
2. When sound is detected:
   - \`\`AudioRecorder\`\` records until silence is detected or the max time elapses.
   - The recorded audio is saved as a WAV file.
3. After recording:
   - A "ping" sound is played (helps to trigger VOX on radios in time for the full file to be played back).
   - The recorded audio is played back through the computer audio output.

### Spy Mode (Silent Recording)

- Same as Standard Mode, but the recorded audio is **not** played back.
- Useful for monitoring and logging radio transmissions without transmission.
- Recordings are automatically kept (cannot be deleted).

### Marker Mode (Channel Monitoring Beacon)

- Instead of repeating transmissions, a periodic marker sound is played at configurable intervals (default: 5 minutes).
- Useful for continuously monitoring a channel without the repeater aspect.
- Does not record user audio.

### User Interface

When \`\`USE_GUI = true\`\` (default), a full graphical interface is available featuring:
- **Start/Stop Controls** – Begin and stop the repeater operation.
- **Settings Panel** – Toggle operating modes, storage options, and UI preferences in real-time.
- **Console Output** – View all logs and system messages with timestamps.
- **Status Indicators** – Real-time status of the repeater, recorder, and listener components.
- **Theme Support** – Switch between dark and light modes.
- **Emergency Close** – Safe shutdown with confirmation if the repeater is running.

## 🔄 Typical Use Cases

### 1. **Amateur Radio Repeater (Simplex)**
   - Acts as a voice repeater that listens for incoming transmissions and repeats them back.
   - Ideal for amateur radio simplex operations on a single frequency.

### 2. **Channel Monitoring**
   - Use Marker Mode to periodically monitor that you're still on frequency.
   - Confirms channel is active without transmitting actual traffic.

### 3. **Voice Test Repeater (Parrot)**
   - Test your radio transmit and audio quality by having your transmissions echoed back.
   - Perfect for testing audio settings in amateur radio setups.

### 4. **Silent Radio Surveillance & Logging (Spy Mode)**
   - Record radio transmissions without playing them back.
   - Ideal for emergency dispatch monitoring, frequency logging, or silent radio surveillance.
   - All recordings are automatically kept for later review.

### 5. **GUI-Based Station Control**
   - Modern cross-platform interface for easy repeater management.
   - No command-line knowledge required.
   - Toggle modes and settings on-the-fly without restarting.`;
